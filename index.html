    Circuit: It is a physical channel that is dedicated to one communication
    through the communication. Mostly used in non-data communication.
    Inefficient in data communication, Data usually has Burst nature. Packet:
    Breaking the communication down into packets. Destination address contained
    within each packet, plus some other redundancies. The same physical channel
    can be shared among many nodes in a network. Each packet can take a
    different route to its destination (connectionless). Packets of one session
    may be unordered. Packets can have redundancies such as packet numbers.
    Multiple Access Techniques which are used to provide communication service
    to multiple users over a single channel simultaneously.

    Multiple access means many can access at one time, one sends many receive
    but only one is the desired receiver (if unicast), such as Ethernet.
</p>
<p>
    Multiplexing is a process to combine multiple signals for transmitting it
    (the combined) over a single channel or media. Generally multiplexing
    combines several lower-speed signals for transmission over a single
    higher-speed connection. One sends, different data, one receives, different
    data. ADSL uses a type of Multiplexing to separate data and voice.

            5-layer model?
        </strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    - OSI model is a generic model that is based upon functionalities of each
    layer. TCP/IP model is a protocol-oriented standard.
</p>
<p>
    - OSI model distinguishes the three concepts, namely, services, interfaces,
    and protocols. TCP/IP does not have a clear distinction between these
    three.
</p>
<p>
    - OSI model gives guidelines on how communication needs to be done, while
    TCP/IP protocols layout standards on which the Internet was developed. So,
    TCP/IP is a more practical model.
</p>
<p>
    - In OSI, the model was developed first and then the protocols in each
    layer were developed. In the TCP/IP suite, the protocols were developed
    first and then the model was developed.
</p>

        <strong>Explain about FHSS, DSSS, OFDM.</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) FHSS is a method of transmitting
    radio signals by rapidly changing the carrier frequency among many distinct
    frequencies occupying a large spectral band. The changes are controlled by
    a code known to both transmitter and receiver. FHSS is used to avoid
    interference, to prevent eavesdropping, and to enable code-division
    multiple access (CDMA) communications. The available frequency band is
    divided into smaller sub-bands. Signals rapidly change ("hop") their
    carrier frequencies among the center frequencies of these sub-bands in a
    predetermined order. Interference at a specific frequency will only affect
    the signal during a short interval. Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
    In telecommunications, direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) is a spread
    spectrum modulation technique primarily used to reduce overall signal
    interference. The direct-sequence modulation makes the transmitted signal
    wider in bandwidth than the information bandwidth. After the dispreading or
    removal of the direct-sequence modulation in the receiver, the information
    bandwidth is restored, while the unintentional and intentional interference
    is substantially reduced. Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
    In telecommunications, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is
    a type of digital transmission and a method of encoding digital data on
    multiple carrier frequencies. OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for
    wideband digital communication, used in applications such as digital
    television and audio broadcasting, DSL internet access, wireless networks,
    power line networks, and 4G/5G mobile communications.

    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    In simplex mode, the signal is sent in one direction. In half duplex mode,
    the signal is sent in both directions, but one at a time. In full duplex
    mode, the signal is sent in both directions at the same time. In simplex
    mode, only one device can transmit the signal. Advantages of Half-Duplex
    Mode It is easy to implement. There is a need for less complicated
    hardware. There is a less congested network in this mode of transmission.
    We can make use of only one antenna which can be used as both the receiver
    and the sender. Disadvantage of half-duplex The speed of half-duplex is
    less as compared to the full-duplex mode of transmission. Advantages of
    Full-Duplex Mode There is an increase in the performance of the network in
    this mode. The speed of transmitting and receiving the data is faster in
    this mode. It doubles the utilization of the bandwidth. Identifying the
    problem is easy in full-duplex transmission mode.
</p>
<p>
    Disadvantages of full-duplex Mode All network equipment does not support a
    full-duplex system. It is expensive when we want to upgrade our system to
    full-duplex. Sometimes it may cause instability. Due to this, it may become
difficult for the administrators to diagnose the issue in the network.    <strong></strong>

    When one of the application programs in one host uses RRP (Request/reply
    protocol) to send a message to its peer (another host). From RRP’s
    perspective, the message it is given by the application is an uninterpreted
    string of bytes. Actually, RRP does not care that these bytes represent an
    array or email or a digital message, or whatever. However, RPR must
    communicate control information to its peer, instructing it how to handle
    the message when it is received. RRP does this by attaching a header to the
    message. In fact, a header is a small data structure- from a few bytes to a
    few dozen byte that is used among peers to communicate with each other

        </strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Unicast: this type of information transfer is useful when there is a
    participation of single sender and single recipient. So, we can term it as
    a one-to-one transmission: for example, a device having IP address 10.1.2.0
    in a network wants to send the traffic stream (data packets) to the device
    with IP address 20.12.4.2 in the other network, then unicast comes into the
    picture. Broadcast: the term broadcast refers to one-to-all. Actually, in
    broadcast routing, the network layer provides a service of delivering a
    packet sent from a source node to all other nodes in the network, for
    example, ipv4 address 255.255.255.255 is used as broadcast address.
    Multicast: the term multicast refers to “one-to-selected group of members”
    Actually, multicast routing enables a single source node to send a copy of
    a packet to a subset of the other network nodes. For example: protocols
    such as IGMP, MPLS use the multicast transmission concept. Anycast
    addressing: it is a one-to-one-of-many association where datagram is routed
    to any single member of a group of potential receivers from the group based
    on least-expensive routing metric. In practice, this means that packets are
    routed to the topologically-nearest member of an anycast group.

</ol>
<p>
    Multicast routing: a networking method for efficient distribution of
    one-to-many traffic. The goal of multicast routing is to find an efficient
    tree of links, before Multicast data forwarding, connects all of the
    routers that have attached hosts belonging to the multicast group. The tree
    may contain routers that do not have attached hosts belonging to the
    multicast group. Methods: Graph Theory Shortest Path Tree or Source-Based
    Tree Minimum-Cost Tree Source Base Trees and Core Base Trees.

        <strong>Explain about IGMPv2 Membership Reports.</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    IGMPv2 Membership Reports are generated by IGMPv2 hosts when they first
    join a multicast group, and are sent in response to IGMPv2 Membership
    Queries. When an IGMPv2 host first joins a multicast group (such as when a
    multicast application is started on the host), it issues a couple of IGMPv2
    Membership Reports, allowing for the possibility that the first one was
    lost or corrupted. After that, IGMPv2 Membership Reports are not sent
    unless a multicast router has issued an IGMPv2 Membership Query. Typically,
    an IGMPv2 host will only respond to a Membership Query with an IGMPv2
    Membership Report when it can tell for certain that an IGMPv2 multicast
    router is on the network. This is determined by examining the Maximum
    Response Time field in a Membership Query. If the field is not blank, then
    the sender is probably an IGMPv2 multicast router. Not all hosts will
    respond to Membership Queries. If another host responds for a multicast
    group that this host is also participating in, then this host can abort the
    response for that group.

    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In a source-based approach, an individual routing tree is constructed for
    each sender in the multicast group. In a multicast group with N hosts, N
    different routing trees will be constructed for that single multicast
    group. In this method, packets will be routed to multicast group members in
    a source specific manner. One advantage of this method is that if one
    multicast router leaves the tree (Group), there is no further cost to
    construct a new tree. Also, it is modular. The drawback is that it uses one
    tree for every sender and group and also it is not scalable. \

        46. Explain the concept of (PIM protocol) along with its variant?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    PIM is abbreviation of protocol-independent multicast which is the most
    widely used internet multicast routing protocol. This protocol explicitly
    recognizes two multicast distribution scenarios. The first one is dense
    mode. In dense mode, multicast group members are densely located, that is,
    many or most of the routers in the area need to be involved in routing
    multicast datagrams. PIM dense mode is a flood-and-prune reverse path
    forwarding technique similar in spirit to DVMRP. The second one is Sparse
    mode In sparse mode, the number of routers with attached group members is
    small with respect to the total number of routers. In fact, group members
    are widely dispersed. PIM sparse mode uses rendezvous points to set up the
    multicast distribution tree. In PIM SM, routers explicitly join the
    multicast distribution tree using PIM protocol messages known as join
    messages. Also, we should consider that PIM SM assigns to each group a
    special router known as the rendezvous point. IN general, a number of
    routers in a domain are configured to be candidate RPs and PIM-SM defines a
    set of procedures by which all the routers in a domain can agree on the
    router to use on the RP for a given group.

<p>
    <strong>47. How does an Anycast network mitigate a DDoS attack?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    After other DDoS mitigation tools filter out some of the attack traffic,
    Anycast distributes the remaining attack traffic across multiple data
    centers, preventing any one location from becoming overwhelmed with
    requests. If the capacity of the Anycast network is greater than the attack
    traffic, the attack is effectively mitigated. In most DDoS attacks, many
    compromised "zombie" or “bot” computers are used to form what is known as a
    botnet. These machines can be scattered around the web and generate so much
    traffic that they can overwhelm a typical Unicast-connected machine. A
    properly Any casted CDN increases the surface area of the receiving network
    so that the unfiltered denial-of-service traffic from a distributed botnet
    will be absorbed by each of the CDN’s data centers. As a result, as a
    network continues to grow in size and capacity it becomes harder and harder
    to launch an effective DDoS against anyone using the CDN.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>48. What is the goal of multicast routing?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The goal of multicast routing is to find an efficient tree of links, before
    Multicast data forwarding, that connects all of the routers that have
    attached hosts belonging to the multicast group.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        49. Explain the idea of reverse path forwarding in multicast routing?
    </strong>
    When a router receives a multicast packet with a given source address, it
    transits the packet on all of its outgoing links only if the packet arrived
    on the link that is on its own shortest path back to the sender otherwise
    the router simply discards the incoming packet without forwarding it on any
    of its outgoing links. In fact, RPF will check the routing table and check
    which egress interface the router would use if it were to send traffic back
    to the multicast sender, if the interface matches the interface the
    multicast packet has just been received on, the packet is accepted,
    otherwise, it is dropped.

<p>
    <strong>
        51. What options does a user have for selecting a multicast address?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Register with IANA for static multicast address (global), or use GLOP
    reserved Address (static, regional). Using GLOP reserved Address (static,
    regional), you can map directly between AS (Autonomous System) and
    Multicast addresses with prefix 233/8. Provides each AS with /24 addresses
    to use (Every AS can use just 256 Multicast addresses). E.G.: AS 5662 (hex:
    0x16.1e; or: 22.30) can use multicast addresses 233.22.30.0/24-
    233.22.30.255/24.

</p>
<p>
    AWS: Amount of data that the receiver will buffer. It is contained in the
    TCP header. From receiver 's side. TWS: the amount of unacknowledged data,
    i.e., data that TCP transmits in a burst without receiving any indication
    on what happened to the data. TWS[n] = min (AWS, CWND[n]); from now on we
    suppose TWS[n] = CWND[n]. In TCP, there is an ACK for every successfully
    sent packet.

    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The main difference is that in congestion avoidance mode in each RTT, the
    value of CWND[n] will be increased by just 1 unit while in slow start mode
    in each RTT, the value of CWND[n]will be Multiplied by 2. Another
    difference is that the increment in congestion avoidance is linear but

<p>

</p>
<p>
    - Within a connection or association. Each message sent to
</p>
<p>
    - A data stream can have a different final
</p>
<p>
    - Destination(application), but each must maintain message boundaries.
</p>
<p>
    - Only the stream that is affected by Head-of-Line Blocking would be
    blocked; the other streams would continue to flow.
</p>
<p>
    - Message: unit of data in application layer.
</p>
<p>
    - Allows multiple simultaneous data streams within a connection or
    association. Each message sent to a data stream can have a different final
    destination, but each must maintain message boundaries.
</p>

    cwnd(t) to the value of WTCP(t). else if cwnd(t) &lt; Wmax, then it is in
    the concave region of the flatness mode. The new cwnd is adjusted according
    to W(t). At each ACK it is incremented by ( W(t) – cwnd(t) ) / cwnd(t)
    else, (or else if cwnd(t) &gt; Wmax), then it is in the convex region of
    the flatness mode. The window is adjusted according to W(t). At each ACK ,
    incremented by ( W(t) – cwnd(t) ) / cwnd(t).

        67. What is the difference between single TCP and Parallel TCP?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Parallel transport control protocol (TCP) has been used to effectively
    utilize bandwidth for data intensive applications over high bandwidth-delay
    product (BDP) networks. On the other hand, it has been argued that a single
    based TCP connection with proper modification such as HSTCP can emulate and
    capture the robustness of parallel TCP and can well replace it. The
    experiment results show that single-based TCP cannot overcome parallel TCP
    especially in heterogeneous networks where the packet losses are common.
    Furthermore, the proposed parallel TCP does not affect TCP fairness which
    makes parallel TCP highly recommended to effectively utilize bandwidth for
    data intensive applications.

        69. What is the main difference between TCP and DDP when a packet is
        lost?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The reliability in TCP is complete. It means that, in the case of each
    packet lost, that packet will be transmitted again or will be transmitted.
    But in DCCP, if there is any packet lost, that packet will not be
    transmitted, but indirectly, DCCP, in the case of any congestion,
    understands congestion by using ECN and so decreasing the transmition rate
    in order to decrease the probability of packet loss.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>70. What are SCTP Packets? </strong>
</p>
<p>
    A segment (packet) in TCP and a packet in SCTP.An association may send many
    packets. A packet may contain several chunks, control and data.Data chunks
    may belong to different streams.Messages are encapsulated in data chunks. A
    stream in a packet, can have no data chunk (just control chunks) or can
    have some data chunks.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>71. Explain about the congestion window. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In TCP, the congestion window is one of the factors that determines the
    number of bytes that can be sent out at any time. The congestion window is
    maintained by the sender and is a means of stopping a link between the
    sender and the receiver from becoming overloaded with too much traffic.
    This should not to be confused with the sliding window maintained by the
    sender which exists to prevent the receiver from becoming overloaded. The
    congestion window is calculated by estimating how much congestion there is
    on the link.
</p>
<p>
    When a connection is set up, the congestion window, a value maintained
    independently at each host, is set to a small multiple of the MSS allowed
    on that connection. Further variance in the congestion window is dictated
    by an additive increase/multiplicative decrease (AIMD) approach. This means
    that if all segments are received and the acknowledgments reach the sender
    on time, some constant is added to the window size. When the window reaches
    ssthresh, the congestion window increases linearly at the rate of 1/
    (congestion window) segment on each new acknowledgement received. The
    window keeps growing until a timeout occurs. On timeout:
</p>
<p>
    - Congestion window is reset to 1 MSS.
</p>
<p>
    - ssthresh is set to half the congestion window size before the timeout.
</p>
<p>
    - Slow start is initiated.
</p>
<p>
    A system administrator may adjust the maximum window size limit, or adjust
    the constant added during additive increase, as part of TCP tuning. The
    flow of data over a TCP connection is also controlled by the use of the
    receive window advertised by the receiver. By comparing its own congestion
    window with the receive window, a sender can determine how much data it may
    send at any given time.

    <strong>76. What is the Best Effort service and QoS? </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Best Effort service: Most traffic on the Internet All users obtain
    best-effort service. No guarantee of delay, throughput and jitter.
    Dedicating resources randomly and uniformly. All users have the same class.
    All users have the equal chances for resources. Lack of resources causes
    packet loss to all users with equal chances. The pre-defined state of core
    nodes, and switches. QoS: Adjustable on core nodes and switches.
    Implementation in layers 3 (IP) and 2 (Ethernet). Supported by IPv4 and
    IPv6. Different policies for different flows. Ranking (grading) or
    classifying different flows in layer 3 (or 2). Classified packets, no
    further fragmentation.

<p>
    <strong>77. Explain IntServ Admission control:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    In RSVP Determines whether to accept a request.Per-flow decision to admit
    or reject a new flow.Admission control looks at TSpec and RSpec and decides
    if a desired service can be provided to that amount of traffic.If yes,
    accept the flow, if not reject the QoS for that flow.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        78. What are the prerequisites of IntServe or Integrated Services?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Call Setup: Flows that need, and are allowed, QoS, demand for resources
    (Buffers and Link BW) reservation from routers and switches. Reserved
    Resources: Each router which can support the required resources added to
    explicit routes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>79. What is Tspec &amp; Rspec?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Traffic Specification, Reserved Specification.
</p>
<p>
    Tspec from sender application by PATH.
</p>
<p>
    Rspec from receiver application by RESV.
</p>
<p>
    In Qos they are parameters for Queue Management and Scheduling.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        80. Explain reservation Application layer protocol (RSVP) and what
        types are there and when RSVP is treated?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In layer 3 (routers) or 2 (switches). Before, and during, the connection a
    reservation Application layer protocol (RSVP) defines an End-to-End path,
    if possible. Queuing and Scheduling based on resources reserved by RSVP.
    Two types. Defined by the application (in RSVP). Guaranteed Service and
    Controlled load Service. Each flow (sender-receiver) reserves resources
    separately. A resource reservation setup protocol that is used by both
    network hosts and routers, sender ↔ receiver. RSVP treats an application
    flow (main data) as a simplex connection. Main data travels only in one
    direction from the sender to the receiver.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>81. What are Leaky Bucket features?</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The input rate can vary (e.g. burst).
</p>
<p>
    The output rate remains constant,r.
</p>
<p>
    Token independent.
</p>
<p>
    If the bucket is full, the packet is discarded.
</p>
<p>
    Packets are transmitted continuously.
</p>
<p>
    Sends the packets at a constant rate.
</p>
<p>
    Does not save tokens.
</p>
<p>
    Tokens are real input traffic bytes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>82. Explain about Tspec and Rspec. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    - Traffic Specification, Reserved Specification.
</p>
<p>
    - Tspec from sender application by PATH.
</p>
<p>
    - Rspec from receiver application by RESV.
</p>
<p>
    - In QoS they are parameters for Queue Management and Scheduling. Token
    bucket specification (TSpec)
</p>
<p>
    r: Token rate Bytes of IP datagrams per second (1 bytes per second to 40
    terabytes per second)
</p>
<p>
    b: Bucket depth Bytes (1 byte to 250 gigabytes)
</p>
<p>
    p: Peak traffic rate Bytes of IP datagrams per second (1 byte per second to
    40 terabytes per second)
</p>
<p>
    m: Minimum policed. All IP datagrams of size less than m will be considered
    with size m. Unit Bytes
</p>
<p>
    M: Maximum packet size; Flows requesting M greater than the link MTU must
    be rejected. Unit Bytes
</p>
<p>
    Resource specification (RSpec)– for guaranteed service
</p>
<p>
    R: Required service rate Greater than or equal to token rate, it is minimum
    output rate; R &lt; out. rate &lt; =p
</p>
<p>
    S: Slack term, unit ms Difference between desired delay and the delay
    obtained using the required service rate
</p>
<p>
    <strong>83. Why IntServ models?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Guaranteed Service.
</p>
<p>
    Controlled Load Service.
</p>
<p>
    Each model needs Admission control Policing and Scheduling.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>84. What are Error Messages and Tear Messages? </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Error Messages: PathErr (PATH Error) and ResvErr (RESV Error), These
    messages are used in the event of unavailability of the requested resource.
    Tear Messages: PathTear and ResvTear, these messages are used to clear the
    PATH or RESV states from the network.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>85. What are IntServ constraints?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Is not scalable;
</p>
<p>
    Especially at Backbone routers.
</p>
<p>
    The more flows with QoS requests, the more problems.
</p>
<p>
    Set up and maintain per-flow state information.
</p>
<p>
    Periodically PATH and RESV messages overhead.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the worst case: all users request QoS.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>86. What are the features of Leaky Bucket?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The input rate can vary The output rate remains constant and it is equal to
    r 20 It is token independent. It means that r is independent from input. If
    the bucket is full, the packet is discarded. Packets are transmitted
    continually. Sends the packets at constant rate It doesn’t save tokens also
    consider that tokens are real input traffic bytes

</p>
<p>
    <strong>87. Explain DiffServe or Differentiated Services:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Tries to be both scalable and flexible
</p>
<p>
    Aggregation of flows; reservations for a group of flows, not per flow.
</p>
<p>
    Two sets of functional elements:
</p>
<p>
    Edge functions: packet classification and traffic conditioning.
</p>
<p>
    Core function: packet forwarding.
</p>
<p>
    Ingress routers (Edge routers):
</p>
<p>
    Uses the type of service field (IPv4) or the traffic class field (IPv6) to
    classify and to set bits DSCP in packet header
</p>
<p>
    Police/Shape traffic.
</p>
<p>
    Subsequent routers (cores) treat the packets according to the DSCP.
</p>
<p>
    Core routers:
</p>
<p>
    Process packets based on DSCP.
</p>
<p>
    A DSCP marked packet is forwarded according to a per-hop behavior (PHB).
</p>
<p>
    The PHB should be based on the DSCP only. Simple forwarding, no need for
    QoS states for each source-destination pair (vs IntServ).
</p>
<p>
    packets with same DSCP are treated equally, regardless of source or
    destination (traffic aggregating)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        88. Define the concept of scheduling and what are its methods?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Fair Queuing
</p>
<p>
    Used for Best Effort, not for QoS.
</p>
<p>
    One Queue for each flow’s packets.
</p>
<p>
    Flows without privilege (superiority).
</p>
<p>
    Round Robin scheduling; handling all flows without priority (also known as
    cyclic executive). Packet oriented.
</p>
<p>
    Flows with larger packets use more BW
</p>
<p>
    Weighted Fair Queuing
</p>
<p>
    One Queue for each flow’s packets.
</p>
<p>
    Flows with privilege (superiority).
</p>
<p>
    Round Robin scheduling; handling all flows, but with priority. Higher class
    or rank, takes more BW Also called Weighted Round Robin.
</p>

    <strong>89. Explain DSCP, Differentiated Service Code Point:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Class assigning.
</p>
<p>
    In each packet.
</p>
<p>
    A 6-bit code.
</p>
<p>
    In IPv4, 6 bits of TOS byte.
</p>
<p>
    In IPv6, 6 bits of Traffic Class.
</p>
<p>
    Ipv4 packet, DSCP bits.
</p>
<p>
    2^6 = 64 classes, only
</p>
<p>
    <strong>90. What is Guaranteed Service?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Firm bound on data throughput and delay Every element along the path must
    provide delay bound Is not always implementable, e.g., Ethernet Delay
    jitter or average delay not guaranteed or minimized Queue management is
    leaky-bucket, based on r and b of Tspec Scheduling is Weighted Fair queuing
    based on R of Rspec
</p>
<p>
    <strong>91. What is IEEE 802.1p?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    QoS on layer 2, LANs and LANs’ switches.
</p>
<p>
    Because BW is usually sufficient on LANs, QoS is not an important problem
    on LANs.
</p>
<p>
    This protocol can define a type of QoS with just 8 different classes. Only
    3 bits in Ethernet packets (frame). Classes from DiffServ or IntServe
    undergo overlap here.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>92. What is DiffServe and its functional elements? </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    DiffServe Tries to be both scalable and flexible Aggregation of flows;
    reservations for a group of flows, not per flow. Functional elements: Edge

    <strong>98. What is a denial of service attack (DoS attack)? </strong>
</p>
<p>

<p>
    WEP:RC4 , WPA:TKIP with RC4.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>100. What are the different types of DoS and DDoS attack? </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Methods:
</p>
<p>
    - Saturating the target with external communications requests (such that it
    can’t respond to legitimate traffic) – SERVER OVERLOAD
</p>
<p>
    - May include malware to max out target resources (such as CPU), trigger
    errors, or crash the OS.
</p>
<p>
    Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks
</p>
<p>
    - DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks are more dynamic and come
    from a broader.
</p>
<p>
    - Examples: SYN flooding, Smurf attacks, Starvation and Ping of Death (POD)
    attack.
</p>
<p>
    Ping of Death (POD)
</p>
<p>
    The attacker aims to disrupt a targeted machine by sending a packet larger
    than the maximum allowable size (65535 Bytes), causing the target machine
    to freeze or crash.
</p>
<p>
    DoS Spoofing Attacks
</p>
<p>
    Phase 1: broadcast an echo request, with fake source address (spoofing),
    destination address in response, which is the victim’s address.
</p>
<p>
    Phase 2: echo reply (flooding) to the victim.
</p>
<p>
    SYN Floods When a computer wants to make a TCP/IP connection to another
    computer, there is an exchange of TCP/SYN and TCP/ACK packets. The computer
    that is trying to connect will send a TCP/SYN packet to the server. The
    server will return a TCP/ACK packet telling the computer it is allowed to
    connect. The server then reserves a space for the incoming connection and
    waits for the computer to respond with another TCP/ACK packet.
</p>
<p>
    The address of the computer requesting a connection is spoofed and when the
    server sends the TCP/ACK packet it is never received by a device or is
    simply ignored. If you do this multiple times to a given server, you will
    take up all the reserved connections (TCB resources) for unresolved hosts
    and other legitimate hosts will not be able to connection to the server.
</p>
<p>
    Smurfing
</p>
<p>
    Phase 1: broadcast a ping request, with fake source address (spoofing),
    which is the destination address in response, which is the victim’s
    address.
</p>
<p>
    Phase 2: echo reply (flooding) to the victim.

    <strong>
        101. Which one of the security protocols in the computer network is
        more secure?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    WPA2.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        102. What is the difference between a trusted zone and a DMZ?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Trusted Zone: The inside or trusted zone is also referred to as the private
    zone. As the name implies, this zone contains assets and systems that
    should not be accessed by anyone outside of the organization. This includes
    user workstations, printers, non-public servers, and anything else that is
    considered to be an internal resource. Devices found here have private IP
    addresses assigned in the network. The outside or untrusted zone is also
    known as the public zone. This zone is considered to be outside the control
    of an organization and can be thought of as simply the public internet.
    DMZ: In computer networks, a DMZ (demilitarized zone), also sometimes known
    as a perimeter network or a screened subnetwork, is a physical or logical
    subnet that separates an internal local area network (LAN) from other
    untrusted networks -- usually the public internet. External-facing servers,
    resources and services are located in the DMZ. Therefore, they are
    accessible from the internet, but the rest of the internal LAN remains
    unreachable. This provides an additional layer of security to the LAN as it
    restricts a hacker's ability to directly access internal servers and data
    through the internet. Any service provided to users on the public internet
    should be placed in the DMZ network. Some of the most common of these
    services include web servers and proxy servers, as well as servers for
    email, domain name system (DNS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and voice
    over IP (VoIP).

<p>
    <strong>
        104. Compare IPSec technique in tunnel mode and transport mode.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Tunnel mode: is most commonly used between gateways, or at an end-station
    to a gateway, the gateway acting as a proxy for the hosts behind it.
    Transport mode: no restriction, host to host but is usually used between
    end-stations or between an end-station and a gateway, if the gateway is
    being treated as a host, for example an encrypted Telnet session from a
    workstation to a router, in which the router is the actual destination.
    Transport mode: host-to-host, host-to-gateway / firewall Tunnel mode:
    host-to-gateway or gateway-to-gateway Transport mode secures packet payload
    and leaves IP header unchanged. Routing is such as no IPSec. QoS is
    possible in transport mode. Tunnel mode encapsulates both IP header and
    payload into IPsec packets. New IP header, (Address). No QoS in tunnel
    mode.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>105. What is Virtual Private Network (VPN)?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    An encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network. VPNs
    encrypt your internet traffic and hide your online identity.The encrypted
    connection helps ensure that sensitive data is safely transmitted. Mostly
    implemented on IPSec. Not all VPNs use IPsec. Another protocol for VPNs is
    SSL/TLS, on layers 4 and 5.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        106. How can we provide security on the application layer with SSL?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    End-to-end security is provided by Handshaking, Authentication and
    Encryption.
</p>
<p>
    Encrypts the segments of network connections above the Transport Layer. One
    important usage is HTTPS. Ways of protecting web applications. A standard
    security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and
    a client—typically a web server (website) and a browser, or a mail server
    and a mail client. The transport layer must be TCP, (not UDP). Needs SSL
    certificates. SSL certificates are issued by Certificate issuer (called a
    Certificate Authority or CA). A CA is an outside organization, a trusted
    third party, that generates and gives out SSL certificates. A certificate
    is the digitally signed of the server’s public key and identity by a
    trusted CA. Server’s public key and identity is encrypted by CA’s private
    key. SSL certificate is used to establish a secure connection. To
    authenticate the identity of the website for a client, to deliver the
    server's public key to a client. Secure connection: secure connection, by
    using the server’s public and private keys, or creating a symmetric key
    (session key) communicating it, and then continuing with symmetric key
    encryption (for faster communication), SSL uses session key. To get a
    certificate, you (server A) must create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
    on your server. This process creates a private key (KA-Pr) and public key
    (KA-Pu) on your server. The CSR data file that you send to the SSL
    Certificate issuer (called a Certificate Authority or CA) contains the
    public key. The CA uses the CSR data file and its own private key (KCA-Pr)
    to create a certificate for you (your server), using your public key and
    your identity. The CA never sees your private key.

        models of malware attacks?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Virus: It is a software or computer program that connects itself to another
    software or computer program to harm computer systems. It also replicates
    itself and can’t be controlled remotely. The Spread rate of viruses is
    moderate. The main objective of viruses is to modify the information and
    finally, they are executed via executable files. Worm: Replicate itself to
    slow down the computer system. Worms also replicate themselves. They can be
    controlled remotely. The spread of worms is faster than viruses and Trojan
    horses. The main objective of worms is to eat the system resources. Worms
    are executed via weaknesses in the system. Trojan horse: Rather than
    replicate, capture some important information about a computer system or a
    computer network. But the Trojan horse does not replicate itself. Like
    worms, Trojan horses can also be controlled remotely. Spreading rate of it
    is slow in comparison to both virus and worm. The main objective of the
    Trojan horse is to steal the information. Finally, Trojan horse executes
    through a program and interprets as utility software.

        110. What are Authentication and Authorization and explain their
        differences?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Authentication is the process of asserting the identity of a user before
    granting access into a system. In simple terms, it means verifying users by
    confirming who they say they are. Authorization: refers to validating the
    roles, permissions, and privileges assigned to a specific user. It is
    performed after authentication to grant or deny access rights to users for
    certain resources. Differences: - Authentication: Verifies user identity
    Verifies users to affirm if they are who they say they are Determines via
    factors like user name, password, retina scan Performed before
    authorization Data is transmitted through Token IDs - Authorization:
    Validates access permission Confirms whether users have permission to
    access certain resources Validates users’ permission and privileges to
    access resources through pre-specified rules Performed after authentication
    Data is transmitted through access token.
